My Name:- Ayushi Omar
Years of experience: 2.11Years

1. Tell us about yourself? (Experience, last position, something interesting about you)
I am Ayushi Omar. I completed my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Uttar Pradesh Technical University in 2017. I was born and raised in Hamirpur, Uttar Pradesh.
I am MERN stack developer with 2.11 years of experience. My last company was Daffodil Software where I work as Associate-IT.
In the last 2.11 years, I work on various projects with different roles and responsibilities. I also have experience in the education domain when I was assigned to edu3.manaze.io. It is an education ERP. We were using ReactJS and NodeJS for its development. 
In daffodil, I was an active member of the employee engagement committee. I and my team receive Alchemist Award for our hard work and solutions.

2. What was the best project you worked on, why and what was your role?
Talking about my best project Autoload where I work as a full-stack developer. In this, I usually work on REST API, CURD operations, UI development. 
I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. But in Autoload, I enjoyed working with the rest of the team members. The discussions we had about the pros and cons of each step were just exhilarating. I think it was such a joy to be able to see a project from start to finish. I really learned a lot about teamwork, communication, and the importance of making and sticking to a plan.

3. In past few projects, what could've you done better, and how would you do it today?
I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. What’s really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I was working on a project. Where we have to move data from the MySQL database to MongoDB and merge 2-3 tables in one collection. In this, we did lots of RND and write APIS for transfer data. I think this time a have a better approach and strong logic for APIS.


4. Are you a hard worker? How do you measure hard work?
Yes, I think am. Every person has a much different definition of hard work than the one I have for myself.  I may find smarter ways of achieving the desired outcome, but not all methods yield success. Hard work in this case as well is that relentless effort of improving our efforts may be in a smarter way, but not stopping until we get the desired outcome. That is my word for working hard.


5. Remote work, what is your experience and pros and cons based on that experience?
With the current situation of the COVID-19, everyone everywhere is considering switching to a distributed team culture and has been literally forced by the circumstances to try the remote work experiment. 
Personally, I am not very much interested to work from home. Or course, while working from your couch sounds great in theory, like everything else, it’s important to understand the pros and cons 
PROS:
1. Increased Productivity, Working remotely erases the distractions of the office workplace
2. Flexible Hours, we are able to tend to the many urgent responsibilities in your life that a regular 9-to-5 job would make it harder to accomplish. 
3. Saving Time and Money, by eliminating the commute to work every day, you’re potentially saving thousands of rupees
CONS:
1. forget to clock out, while people might think working from home means doing less, the opposite might be true for diligent employees.
2. feel out of the loop.
3. less collaboration, we are missing out on opportunities to work side by side with our colleagues4. forget to take breaks, while working alone, it’s possible to dive into the rabbit hole and forget to eat or drink for hours.


6. Why we should hire you?
Over the years, I have acquired relevant skills and experience. I work on various projects which have different roles and responsibility that bring lots of learning. I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to this position with you. I would love to bring the coding and content skills I learned there to this position. I hope, I could use all my skills for the development of the organization and self.
